### Contributions and Trust Relationships

Contributors and contributions adhering to the [Acceptable, preferred
content](#markdown-acceptable-preferred-content) guidelines are welcomed.
However, contributions are accepted at the discretion of site administrators
and may be rejected on grounds of trust or other subjective properties. The
content must be objective, but the administrators' relationship with
contributors may not be.

### What to Contribute
#### Material Criteria

Whether an activity is against public interest is measured by meeting one or
more of the following criteria:

1. A public institution has handed down a report that demonstrates an
activity failed to meet legal obligations or required standards. For example,
reports published by the [Australian National Audit Office (ANAO)][anao]

2. An activity that has been reported to disregard advice from relevant public
servants, research or scientific organisations to the detriment of the public

3. Activities reported to [breach ministerial standards as set out by the Department of
the Prime Minister and Cabinet][pmc-ministerial-standards]

4. Activities reported to breach the constitution, federal or state law.

#### Acceptable, preferred content

1. Journal publications, Australian Public Service reports, peer-reviewed
primary source material backing claims
2. News articles from reputable sources
3. Public statements, audio and video material of unelected responsible public servants
4. For the purpose of clarification of position, political party media releases

#### Unacceptable content

* Opinion or editorial news articles
* Articles not linking to acceptable, preferred content as supporting evidence

### How to Contribute

The site is currently developed under the [pubtestme organisation on
Github](pubtestme-repo). Contributions come in several types and can take on
several forms:

#### Forms of Contribution

1. [Opening an issue][pubtestme-new-issue] against the site
2. Developing a change and [opening a pull-request][pubtestme-new-pull-req]

[pubtestme-new-issue]: https://github.com/pubtestme/pubtestme.github.io/issues/new
[pubtestme-new-pull-req]: https://github.com/pubtestme/pubtestme.github.io/compare

#### Types of Contribution

1. Corrections-to or flagging-of content
2. Contributing an incident

Contributions correcting or flagging content must contain a concise statement
of the problem. If the contribution is via opening an issue to identify the
defect then the issue must have title identifying the problem, include a link
to the content at hand, and ideally suggest a resolution.

Contributions of new posts should be self contained: There must be a summary of
the activity in question, and at least one of either a formal report or a news
headline to anchor the activity in reality and time. New posts can be
contributed in both issue and pull-request forms. If an issue is opened and the
activity described meets the [material criteria](#material-criteria) then site
administrators will implement the site changes and attribute them to the issue
owner.

Contributions via pull-requests must adhere to the licensing and legal
requirements outlined below.
